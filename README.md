# Hi, I’m Bhavishya 👋

I like understanding things properly.  
If I don’t know *why* something works, I don’t trust it.

Most of what’s here exists because curiosity wouldn’t let me leave it alone.


## What I work on

- Machine Learning & AI  
- Core CS (DSA, systems, OS)  
- Turning confusion into clean code  

---

## How I operate

- Ask “why” too many times  
- Break things before fixing them  
- Prefer slow + correct over fast + wrong  

If it’s in my repo, I learned something the hard way.

---

## Tools

Python,Java  
Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, PyTorch  
Git, Linux, Docker, FastAPI  

Tools change. Curiosity doesn’t.

---

## Right now

- Getting better at ML (for real)  
- Strengthening CS basics  
- Learning how to build things that don’t fall apart  

---

If you’re here for polished perfection, you won’t find it.  
If you’re here for honest learning—welcome.

⭐ Star if you want. Or don’t. I’ll still do my thing.
